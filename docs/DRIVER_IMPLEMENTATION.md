# Driver Wrapper Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the driver wrapper for the Retroboard RGB LED matrix project. The wrapper provides an abstraction layer that allows code to run on both physical hardware and simulated displays, with full support for double-buffering for smooth, tear-free animations.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. **Canvas (Abstract Base Class)**
- Location: `driver.py`
- Purpose: Defines the drawable surface interface for both main display and frame buffers
- Methods:
  - `set_pixel(x, y, r, g, b)` - Set a single pixel color
  - `clear()` - Clear the entire canvas
  - `fill(r, g, b)` - Fill canvas with solid color
  - `get_width()` - Get canvas width
  - `get_height()` - Get canvas height

#### 2. **MatrixDriver (Extends Canvas)**
- Location: `driver.py`
- Purpose: Defines the interface that all driver implementations must follow
- Additional Methods (beyond Canvas):
  - `create_frame_canvas()` - Create offscreen buffer for double-buffering
  - `swap_on_vsync(canvas, framerate_fraction)` - Atomically swap buffers
  - `get_brightness()` - Get brightness level (0-100)
  - `set_brightness(brightness)` - Set brightness level (0-100)

#### 3. **HardwareFrameCanvasWrapper**
- Location: `driver.py`
- Purpose: Wraps hardware FrameCanvas objects to match Canvas interface
- Implementation: Delegates to underlying hardware FrameCanvas
- Used internally by HardwareDriver for double-buffering

#### 4. **SimulatedFrameCanvasWrapper**
- Location: `driver.py`
- Purpose: Provides simulated frame canvas for testing
- Implementation: Maintains its own 2D buffer
- Additional method: `get_buffer()` for inspection

#### 5. **HardwareDriver**
- Location: `driver.py`
- Purpose: Interfaces with real RGB LED matrix hardware
- Implementation: Wraps the `rpi-rgb-led-matrix` library's `RGBMatrix` class
- Features:
  - Accepts standard configuration (rows, cols, hardware_mapping)
  - Can accept pre-configured `RGBMatrixOptions` for advanced use
  - Caches dimensions for performance
  - Creates HardwareFrameCanvasWrapper for double-buffering
  - Supports brightness control

#### 6. **SimulatedDriver**
- Location: `driver.py`
- Purpose: Provides in-memory simulation for testing and future web emulation
- Implementation: Maintains a 2D array of RGB tuples
- Features:
  - Bounds checking to prevent index errors
  - `get_buffer()` method to inspect current state
  - No hardware dependencies
  - Full double-buffering simulation with buffer swapping
  - Brightness tracking (doesn't affect actual output in simulation)

#### 7. **Factory Function**
- Function: `create_driver(use_hardware, **kwargs)`
- Purpose: Simplifies driver instantiation
- Usage: Single boolean flag switches between hardware and simulation

## Design Decisions

### 1. **Canvas Hierarchy**
Introduced a Canvas base class that both drivers and frame buffers implement:
- Consistent interface for all drawable surfaces
- Enables double-buffering with same API
- Frame canvases work identically to main display
- Clean separation between drawing operations and driver management

### 2. **Abstraction Level**
Core Canvas interface has 5 methods, MatrixDriver adds 4 more. This makes it:
- Easy to implement new backends
- Simple to understand and use
- Focused on essential operations
- Support for both immediate mode and double-buffering

### 3. **Naming Conventions**
Used snake_case for Python convention:
- `set_pixel()` instead of `SetPixel()`
- `get_width()` instead of `width` property

This maintains consistency with Python standards while wrapping the C++-style RGBMatrix API.

### 4. **Factory Pattern**
The `create_driver()` function provides a simple way to switch implementations:
- No need to import specific driver classes in application code
- Single boolean flag for hardware vs. simulation
- Easy to extend with more driver types later

### 5. **Double-Buffering Architecture**
Mirrored the rpi-rgb-led-matrix pattern:
- `create_frame_canvas()` creates offscreen buffer
- `swap_on_vsync()` atomically swaps buffers
- Returns old canvas for reuse (avoids allocations)
- Prevents tearing and flicker in animations

The simulation faithfully reproduces this:
- Creates separate buffer for frame canvas
- Deep copies buffers during swap
- Maintains buffer independence

### 6. **Comments and Documentation**
Every class, method, and function is documented with:
- Module-level docstrings explaining purpose
- Detailed parameter descriptions
- Usage examples where appropriate
- Implementation notes for clarity

### 7. **No Dependencies on Simulation**
The `SimulatedDriver` has zero external dependencies, making it:
- Easy to run on any system
- Fast for testing
- Ready for future web integration

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from driver import create_driver

# Create driver
driver = create_driver(use_hardware=False, width=32, height=32)

# Draw a red pixel
driver.set_pixel(15, 15, 255, 0, 0)

# Fill with blue
driver.fill(0, 0, 255)

# Clear
driver.clear()
```

### Switching Between Hardware and Simulation
```python
# Change this one line to switch modes
USE_HARDWARE = False  # or True for real hardware

driver = create_driver(
    use_hardware=USE_HARDWARE,
    rows=32,
    cols=32,
    hardware_mapping="adafruit-hat"
)

# Rest of code works identically
driver.set_pixel(0, 0, 255, 0, 0)
```

### Double-Buffering Pattern
```python
from driver import create_driver

driver = create_driver(use_hardware=True)

# Create offscreen canvas
canvas = driver.create_frame_canvas()

# Animation loop
while True:
    # Draw to offscreen buffer
    canvas.clear()
    canvas.set_pixel(x, y, 255, 0, 0)
    
    # Swap atomically, get old buffer back
    canvas = driver.swap_on_vsync(canvas)
```

## Future Enhancements

The driver wrapper is designed to support:

1. **Web Visualization**
   - Add WebSocket support to `SimulatedDriver`

   - Display frame canvas buffers alongside main display

2. **Image Support**
   - Add `set_image()` method to Canvas interface
   - Support PIL/Pillow images
   - Handle image offsets and clipping

3. **Additional Backends**
   - Terminal-based display using ANSI colors
   - PNG/GIF export for documentation
   - Remote display over network

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - FPS counter
   - Timing statistics
   - Diagnostic output

## How to Test

### Without Hardware
```bash
# Run the test suite
python3 test_driver.py

# Run examples in simulation mode
# (Edit files to set USE_HARDWARE = False)
python3 example_driver.py
python3 example_double_buffer.py  # Shows double-buffering
python3 sprinkles.py

- Documentation: ~260 lines README + implementation notes

All additions maintain the lean, focused design while providing essential animation capabilities.

## Conclusion
