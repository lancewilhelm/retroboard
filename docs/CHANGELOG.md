# Retroboard Changelog

## Reorganization - Drivers Package

### Changes

**Moved files into organized structure:**
- `driver.py` → `drivers/matrix.py`
- `text/` → `drivers/text/`
- Created `drivers/__init__.py` with clean exports

**Updated imports in all files:**
- All examples now use `from drivers import ...`
- Consistent import pattern across the project
- No functionality changes, just better organization

### New Import Pattern

```python
# Everything from one place
from drivers import create_driver, BDFFont

# Still works for advanced usage
from drivers import HardwareDriver, SimulatedDriver, Canvas, MatrixDriver
```

### Benefits

1. **Single Package**: All driver-related code in one place
2. **Clean Imports**: One import statement gets everything
3. **Clear Organization**: Related functionality grouped together
4. **Easy to Find**: Obvious where driver code lives
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new drivers or features

### Files Modified

**Core:**
- Created `drivers/` package
- Moved `driver.py` → `drivers/matrix.py`
- Moved `text/` → `drivers/text/`
- Created `drivers/__init__.py`

**Examples:**
- `clock.py` - Updated imports
- `scroll_text.py` - Updated imports
- `test_text.py` - Updated imports
- `stars.py` - Updated imports
- `examples/example_driver.py` - Updated imports
- `examples/example_double_buffer.py` - Updated imports

**Tests:**
- `tests/test_driver.py` - Updated imports

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Updated structure and examples
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Updated import statements
- Created `STRUCTURE.md` - Documents new organization
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` - This file

### Verification

All code has been tested and verified to work:
- ✅ Imports work correctly
- ✅ Driver creation works
- ✅ Font loading works
- ✅ Text rendering works
- ✅ All examples run successfully
- ✅ No errors or warnings in diagnostics

### Migration Guide

If you have existing code:

**Old Way:**
```python
from driver import create_driver
from text import BDFFont
```

**New Way:**
```python
from drivers import create_driver, BDFFont
```

That's it! Everything else stays the same.
